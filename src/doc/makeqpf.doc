\title makeqpf

This tool is used to save QPF font files by rendering and saving fonts.

<h1> Compiling makeqpf</h1>
<ul>
<li> QT_NO_QWS_TRANSFORMED and QT_NO_QWS_SAVEFONTS must not be defined by your qconfig</li>
<li> QT_TRANSFORM_VFB must be defined if you wish to run makeqpf under QVFb</li>
<li> QT_NO_BDF must not be defined should you wish to process BDF files</li>
<li> QT_NO_FREETYPE must not be defined should you wish to process TTF files</li>
</ul>

Typically this means doing a build of Qt/Embedded selecting the makeqpf configure. For example:

<code>
./configure -qconfig makeqpf [extra options] <br>
make <br>
make -C tools/makeqf<br>
</code>

<h2> QWS fonts <h2>

  Makeqpf, like any other Qt/Embedded application, relies on $QTDIR/lib/fonts/fontdir to correctly list the available fonts. 
For more information see \link fonts-qws.html QWS Fonts \endlink

<h2> Usage</h2>
<code>
makeqpf [-A] [-f spec-file] [font ...]
</code>
<ul>
<li>-A - Render and save all fonts in fontdir</li>
<li>-f - File of lines: fontname character-ranges e.g. "smoothtimes 0-ff,20a0-20af"</li>
<li>font - Font to render and save</li>
</ul>

To make a "fixed" font with the currency symbols, create a file with the line:

<code>fixed 0-ff,20a0-20af</code>

and run <code>makeall -f yourfile</code>

See also <code>./makeqpf --help</code>

Hint:Press CTRL+Key_Q should you wish to quit makeqpf.

Warning: If TTF(Freetype) support is allowed then the freetype development headers libraries need to be available.
