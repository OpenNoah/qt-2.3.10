  \class QMemoryFile qmemoryfile_p.h
  \brief The QMemoryFile class provide means to map a file info memory or refere to a block or memory by name.

  Warning: This class is not part of the Qt APi and subject to change.
             This file file may change from version to version without
             notice, or even be removed.


Currently this
         class supports read only access on all platforms; and read plus write
         accces provided on unix and windows based plaforms.
	 The size of mapped file can not be changed.
*/


/*! \ enum QMemoryFile::Flags
  This enum specifies the possible types of connections made to the file to
  be memory mapped.

   The currently defined values are :

  \value Write  Allow write access to file.
  \value Shared Allow file to be shared with other proceses.
  \value Create Create file named.
 */



/*!
  Construct a memory mapped to an actual file or named memory block.
  If \a fileName is not preceeded by an \\ then it is treated as a real
     file name.
  Otherwise the characters after the \\ are used as the name for the memory block required.
    nb: You will need to escape the \'s so it you need to use \\\\ within a literal string 
  A value for \a size should always be provided, though if the size is not provided it will be determined if possible.

 If a file is being mapped to be written to, then the \a flags of subsequent QMemoryFiles mapped to the same file should include QMemoryFile::Write.

 Example:
 \code
 // Open a maping to file text.dat
 QMemoryFile memoryFile("text.dat", QMemoryFile:Read, 20);
 char *data = memoryFile.data();
 int sum = 0;
 for (int i = 0; i < 20; i++){
   sum = sum + data[i];
 }
 qDebug("Sum =%d", sum);
 \endcode

 Example for creating named memory block:
 \code

 QMemoryFile block1("\\\\block1", QMemoryFile::Create | QMemoryFile::Write, 20);
 char *dataBlock = block.data();
 for (int i = 0; i < 19; i++){
   dataBlock[i] = i +'a';
 }
 dataBlock[20] = '\0';
 qDebug("Data block is %s", dataBlock);
 \endcode

{
    block = NULL;
    length = 0;
    if (flags == -1)
      flags = QMemoryFile::Shared; // read only shared file mapping

    this->flags = flags;
    d = openData(fileName, flags, size);
}

  Destructs the memory mapped file
*/
QMemoryFile::~QMemoryFile()
{
    closeData(d);
}


/*!
 \fn char* QMemoryFile::data()

 Returns a pointer to memory that this QMemoryFile is associated with
*/


/*!
  \fn bool QMemoryFile::isShared()

  Returns true if memory is shared
*/


/*!
 \fn bool QMemoryFile::isWritable()
   
 Returns true if memory is writable
