  \class QImageConsumer qasyncimageio.h
  \brief An abstraction used by QImageDecoder.

  \ingroup images

  A QImageConsumer consumes information about changes to the QImage
  maintained by a QImageDecoder.  It represents the a view of the
  image which the decoder produces.

  \sa QImageDecoder
*/

/*!
  \fn void QImageConsumer::changed(const QRect&)

  Called when the given area of the image has changed.
*/

/*!
  \fn void QImageConsumer::end()

  Called when all data of all frames has been decoded and revealed
  as changed().
*/

/*!
  \fn void QImageConsumer::frameDone()

  One of the two frameDone() functions will be called
  when a frame of an animated image has ended and been revealed
  as changed().

  When this function is called, the current image should be displayed.

  The decoder will not make
  any further changes to the image until the next call to
  QImageFormat::decode().
*/

/*!
  \fn void QImageConsumer::frameDone( const QPoint& offset, const QRect& rect )

  One of the two frameDone() functions will be called
  when a frame of an animated image has ended and been revealed
  as changed().

  When this function is called, the area \a rect in the current image
  should be moved by \a offset and displayed.

  The decoder will not make
  any further changes to the image until the next call to
  QImageFormat::decode().
*/

/*!
  \fn void QImageConsumer::setLooping(int n)

  Called to indicate that the sequence of frames in the image
  should be repeated \a n times, including the sequence during
  decoding.

  <ul>
    <li> 0 = Forever
    <li> 1 = Only display frames the first time through
    <li> 2 = Repeat once after first pass through images
    <li> etc.
  </ul>

  To make the QImageDecoder
  do this just delete it and pass the information to it again
  for decoding (setLooping() will be called again of course, but
  that can be ignored), or keep copies of the
  changed areas at the ends of frames.
*/

/*!
  \fn void QImageConsumer::setFramePeriod(int milliseconds)

  Notes that the frame about to be decoded should not be displayed until
  the given number of \a milliseconds after the time that this function
  is called.  Of course, the image may not have been decoded by then, in
  which case the frame should not be displayed until it is complete.
  A value of -1 (the assumed default) indicates that the image should
  be displayed even while it is only partially loaded.
*/

/*!
  \fn void QImageConsumer::setSize(int, int)

  This function is called as soon as the size of the image has
  been determined.
*/

  support for more incremental image formats, allowing such formats to
  be sources for a QMovie, or for the first frame of the image stream
  to be loaded as a QImage or QPixmap.

  New subclasses must reimplement this method.

  It should decode some or all of the bytes from \a buffer into
  \a img, calling the methods of \a consumer as the decoding proceeds to
  inform that consumer of changes to the image.
  The consumer may be 0, in which case the function should just process
  the data into \a img without telling any consumer about the changes.
  Note that the decoder must store enough state
  to be able to continue in subsequent calls to this method - this is
  the essence of the incremental image loading.

  The function should return without processing all the data if it
  reaches the end of a frame in the input.

  The function must return the number of bytes it has processed.

/*!
  \class QImageFormatType qasyncimageio.h
  \brief Factory that makes QImageFormat objects.

  \ingroup images

  While the QImageIO class allows for \e complete loading of images,
  QImageFormatType allows for \e incremental loading of images.

  New image file formats are installed by creating objects of derived
  classes of QImageFormatType.  They must implement decoderFor()
  and formatName().

  QImageFormatType is a very simple class.  Its only task is to
  recognize image data in some format and make a new object, subclassed
  from QImageFormat, which can decode that format.

  The factories for formats built into Qt
  are automatically defined before any other factory is initialized.
  If two factories would recognize an image format, the factory created
  last will override the earlier one, thus you can override current
  and future built-in formats.
*/

/*!
  \fn virtual QImageFormat* QImageFormatType::decoderFor(const

  This function should only return a decoder if it is definite that the
  decoder applies to data with the given header.  Returns 0 if there is
  insufficient data in the header to make a positive identification,
  or if the data is not recognized.
