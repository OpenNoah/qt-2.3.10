<hr><h2><a name="details"></a>Detailed Description</h2>
The QMemoryManager class provides the allocation and tracking of memory used by pixmaps and font glyphs.
<p>
The QMemoryManager class allocates pixmaps from video ram, main
memory, or now if enabled, shared memory which allows pixmap data
to be shared between Qt/Embedded processes. The shared memory is
managed by the QSharedMemoryManager class which is able to track
allocated and freed memory from it between processes. It works
similar to malloc and free in how it maintains that memory, however
it is implemented in a way to allow this to work from different
processes which may have this memory mapped to different virtual
addresses as well as needing locking during allocation and deallocation.
<p>To make shared memory useful between processes, there needs to be
a common way for different processes to identify and reference the share
items stored in the memory. Therefore items stored are looked up based
on a key, the key also needs to be in the shared memory, and if present
can then be used to map an item in the memory based on the key, much in
the way the pixmap cache already works but in a shared manner that
works across processes. The key searching is implemented using an array
with bsearch for efficency. When the items are added, qsort is used to
keep the item pointers ordered by key so the bsearch works. The choice to
use an array and bsearch was one of efficency, however this means that
the number of items able to be added to the cache is limited by the size
chosen for the array at compile time, however a future improvement could
be to use a dynamic array allocated from shared memory to make it possible
to grow this array as needed. But in most cases it should be possible to
determine the average size of items in the shared memory, which means a
reasonable value for the size of this array should be able to be determined.
A reasonable guess maybe that items will be 1Kb in size on average, some
debug to profile the size of items as they are added to the cache should
make it possible to be more exact for a given environment.
<p>The font glyph caching is very much the same as pixmap caching if
it is possible to generate a key that identifies the glyph or set of glyphs.
Storage of the key is an overhead in font glyph caching, therefore this
cost is reduced if multiple glyphs are cached at a time with the
one key. A value of 16 glyphs at a time was chosen based on testing
of memory usage and the trade off of key overhead caching different
number of glyphs at a time. Originally a row of 256 glyphs were
cached at a time, but trial and error showed that in a test of
text with Japanese text, that typically the characters used spanned
too many of the rows that it very quickly filled the cache and that
the majority of the glyphs cached did not get used. The glyphs used
tended to be from all over the range of unicode characters, and
16 glyphs at a time was reasonable with out filling the test cache
of 1 Mb. Caching multiple glyphs requires that an array in the cached
item indexes the offset to the glyph in the set within the chunk of
shared memory.
<p>When the cache gets full, both the font and pixmap caching
code falls back to their original implementations of allocating and
searching from local memory to that process. Another factor taken
in to account is screen rotation, the key associated with an item
in the shared memory has appended something that identifys the
rotation of the process which added it. This ensures that after
the rotation is changed or an app with a different rotation is
run, it will not find from the cache an incorrectly rotated image
than what it requires.
<p>As with pixmap caching previously, an item
in the cache will remain there while there are still references
to the data. This requires reference counting so that it is
possible to determine when it is safe to reuse the data used by
a cached item. To avoid delays during allocation when memory is
required from the cache, a timer event periodically removes a few
items at a time from the cache which have been identified as
no longer referenced. This provides something similar to
incremental garbage collection. It is possible that after a
dereference and an an item is identified as needing to be removed
it may be referenced again before the timer event, therefore the
timer event must check again the item still has no references.
<p>For extra robustness, some extra locking maybe required in a few
places. Another consideration that requires some additions to the
current code is the abnormal termination of a process which contains
references to items in the cache. To handle this signal handlers will be
required to ensure items get correctly dereferenced in these cases.
This is similar to the same problem with pixmaps allocated from
video ram by a process which ends abnormally.
