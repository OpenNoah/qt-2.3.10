<h3>Master Process</h3>
<p>
Qt/Embedded must have a master process that handles device input
and paintable region management.  Any process may be nominated as the
master process by passing the -qws flag or constructing QApplication as 
the <i>QApplication::GuiServer</i> type.
<p>
The master and client Qt/Embedded processes communicate via a PF_LOCAL socket.
There is also a shared memory area that contains the regions of each
top-level widget.
<p>
The Qt/Embedded model minimises inter-process communication by performing
as much work as possible in the client process.  For example all drawing
and child widget region operations are performed by the client process
without any communication with the master process necessary.
<p>
<h3>Window Management</h3>
<p>
The master process maintains the regions that each top-level widget may
paint within.
Performing one of the following operations on a top-level widget causes
the paintable regions of each top-level widget to be updated:
<ul>
<li>show()
<li>hide()
<li>move(), setGeometry(), resize()
<li>raise(), lower()
</ul>
All of the above operations require one round-trip message to the master
process.  Spontaneous expose events are also generated for any widgets
that have some part of their client area exposed by one of the above
operations.
<p>
Sub-widget regions are not maintained by the master process, so
performing the above operations on child widgets requires no communication
with the master process.
<p>
<h3>Device Input</h3>
<p>
The master process is responsible for reading device input and dispatching
the events to the active client.  Key events and mouse/pointer events
can be handled.
<p>
<h3>QCop</h3>
<p>
The master process controls QCop message delivery.  When a client creates
a QCop <i>channel</i>, the master process adds the client to the list of
clients subscribed to <i>channel</i>.  QCop messages are sent to
the master process which then forwards the messages to each client that
is listening on the channel.
<p>
<h3>Painting</h3>
<p>
QPainter is essentially a wrapper around the <i>Gfx</i> graphics system.
The QGfx class is a high-level painting abstraction.  Sub-classes implement
the actual drawing functionality, in particular, QGfxRaster implements
painting on a raster device.  Hardware acceleration is usually achieved
by sub-classing QGfxRaster, implementing the accelerated functions where
possible, and falling back to the QGfxRaster implementation for functions
unsupported in hardware.
<p>
Qt/Embedded clients paint directly to the framebuffer.  The low-level graphics
system (QGfx) handles clipping against the top-level regions maintained in
shared memory.  No communication with the master process via the socket
is performed.
