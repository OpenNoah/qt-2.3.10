To compile makeqpf 
    o QT_NO_QWS_TRANSFORMED and QT_NO_QWS_SAVEFONTS must not be defined by your qconfig
    o QT_TRANSFORM_VFB must be defined if you wish to run makeqpf under QVFb
    o QT_NO_BDF must not be defined should you wish to process BDF files 
    o QT_NO_FREETYPE must not be defined should you wish to process TTF files 

	    
    Typically this means doing a build of Qt/Embedded selecting the makeqpf configure. eg :
	./configure -qconfig makeqpf [extra options]



To make a "fixed" font with the currency symbols, create a file with the line:

fixed 0-ff,20a0-20af

and run "makeall -f yourfile".

See also ./makeqpf --help 


Hint:Press CTRL+Key_Q should you wish to quit makeqpf.

Warning:If TTF(Freetype) support is allowed then the freetype development headers libraries need to be available.
